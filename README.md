With the rapid growth of computer networks, security has become crucial. Many types of attacks
are developed and different detection techniques have been proposed and deployed up until now.
One of the best techniques in this area is artificial intelligent. Using electronic elements in the new
generation cars has resulted in attacking the cars in which this application has been chosen. In this
paper, a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based IDS model is introduced.
This proposed model for IDS uses Deep Belief Network Neural Network and then used feed
forward to increase the performance of system. This method generates a real time output which is
very important to prevent any harm to the system.
